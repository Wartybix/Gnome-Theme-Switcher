Yass gnome theme switcher 😍😍

Modified from https://askubuntu.com/a/1234819 to store the scripts in a lovely hidden folder in the user directory

Use the cat command to show the crontabs_text file, and copy the output. Then type 'crontab -e' in the terminal and paste the text at the bottom of the file. Save it and enjoy.

Nvm, just use https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/2236/night-theme-switcher/ 😃️.
